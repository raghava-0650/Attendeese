When Git refuses to merge because you’ve got local edits you don’t care about, you can simply throw them away and sync your branch to whatever’s on the remote. Here’s a gentle, step‑by‑step:

Make sure you’re on the branch you want to update (e.g. main):

bash
Copy
git checkout main
Fetch the latest from origin so you know exactly where remote/main is:

bash
Copy
git fetch origin
Hard‑reset your branch to the remote tip, discarding any local commits or edits:

bash
Copy
git reset --hard origin/main
This throws away all changes in tracked files and makes your local main exactly match origin/main.

Remove any untracked files (like that firebase.js you never committed) so nothing extra blocks the merge:

bash
Copy
git clean -fd
The -f flag forces the clean and -d says “also delete untracked directories.”

After those two commands, your working tree is pristine and in perfect sync with the remote. You can now pull, merge, rebase—whatever you like—and there won’t be any leftover local edits to worry about.

⚠️ Warning: This is destructive—any changes you haven’t committed will be lost permanently. Make sure you really don’t need them before you run those commands!
